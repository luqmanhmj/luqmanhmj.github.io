# **About**

<br>
Hi! I am **Luqman** :wave:<br><br>
I was born and raised in a pretty chill city - Miri, Sarawak. As someone who does graphic design on the side, I quickly developed an interest in data visualization in the middle of 2021 when I first introduced to Power BI. Back then I was a trainee engineer, and now I am starting to dabble in data science :D
<br><br>
My other interests include online games, digital art & photography, and rock climbing.
<br><br>
Oh, not to forget coffee and cats too!
