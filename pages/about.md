# **About**

<br>
Hi! I am **Luqman** :wave:<br><br>
I was born and raised in a pretty chill city - Miri, Sarawak. Being someone who does graphic design as a hobby, I developed an interest in data visualization in the middle of 2021. Back then I was a trainee engineer, and now I am starting to dabble in data science :D
<br><br>
As a hobby, I enjoy playing online games, doing digital art, and rock climbing.
<br><br>
Oh, not to forget I love coffee and cats too!
